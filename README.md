The project is modified from [unet-vis](https://github.com/adrijanik/unet-vis)
# Setting tiles path
All of the visualization setting are in the [show code](https://github.com/ShuoShen-Susan/unet-visualization/tree/main/show%20code) folders.The tiles path is defined in [points.js](./data/points.js). Open it. 
- `mask_path_web`: the mask tiles path
- `iou`:  intersection over union
- `pred_path`: the prediction tiles path
- `coords`: the points location in heatmap
- `patch_path`: the original image path
- `patch_path_web`: the original image path
- `mask_path`: the mask tiles path
- `id`: the name of tiles
- `pred_path_web`: the prediction tiles path
All of the parameters are generated by - `IOU.py`

# Setting the tiles' path
The project need three kind of tiles:
- `X`: original image tiles
- `Y`: the ground truth
- `Y_hat`: the result from prediction model
Firstly, you should setting the parameters - `pathX`,  - `pathY` and - `pathY_hat`, represent the path of X, Y ,Y_hat respectively. 

The code would read the corresponding images. 
Then setting the image folder's location:
- `base_path`: indicates the location of unet-vis project
- `image_fold`: the folder under unet-vis to save the tiles

# Save the tiles under  [unet-vs](https://github.com/adrijanik/unet-vis)
The tiles should save under - `image_fold` above, which has three subfolders:
- `X` 
- `Y`
- `Y_hat`
 
you could copy the image to the fold you set or use the following code:
```md
matplotlib.image.imsave(base_path + image_fold +"/X/" + f, f)
matplotlib.image.imsave(base_path + image_fold +"/Y_hat/" + f, pred)
matplotlib.image.imsave(base_path + image_fold + "/Y/"+f, imageY)
```

# Generate points.js
In [unet-vs](https://github.com/adrijanik/unet-vis), the project show the tile by reading the  [points.js](./data/points.js). So we should use   - `IOU.py` to generate a new points.js. And then replace the [points.js](./data/points.js)

The [unet-vs](https://github.com/adrijanik/unet-vis) project will automatically read the [points.js](./data/points.js) and follow the path to find the tiles.
